        "\n",
        "Skewness: Concept and Types :- Skewness is a statistical measure that quantifies the degree of asymmetry or departure from symmetry in a distribution. In a perfectly symmetrical distribution, such as the normal distribution, the skewness value is zero. However, in real-world data, distributions often exhibit some form of skewness, which can either be positive or negative.\n",
        "\n",
        "Definition of Skewness:- Skewness measures the extent to which the distribution of data points in a dataset deviates from a normal distribution. It is calculated using the third standardized moment of the data, and can be interpreted in the following ways:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Zero Skewness (Symmetric distribution): A perfectly symmetric distribution has a skewness value of 0. In a perfectly normal distribution, the left and right tails are identical in length and shape. where mean, median, and mode are all equal.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Positive Skewness (Right-skewed): If the tail on the right side of the distribution (larger values) is longer or more spread out than the left side, the distribution is said to be positively skewed. Data is lying more in right side that why this is inclined. mean>median>mode\n",
        "\n",
        "3. egative Skewness (Left-skewed): If the tail on the left side of the distribution (smaller values) is longer or more spread out than the right side, the distribution is negatively skewed. Data is lying more in left side. mode>median>mean\n",
        "\n",
        "How Skewness Affects Data Interpretation:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Central Tendency (Mean and Median): n a skewed distribution, the mean and median do not coincide. For positively skewed data, the mean is higher than the median, while for negatively skewed data, the mean is lower than the median. The mean is sensitive to outliers and skewness, whereas the median is more robust, especially in highly skewed data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Outliers Detection: Skewness helps identify whether there are extreme values or outliers in the data. In a positively skewed distribution, the right tail may indicate the presence of large outliers, while in a negatively skewed distribution, the left tail may indicate small outliers.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Interpretation of Distribution Shape: Skewness provides insight into the shape of the distribution. For instance, if data is positively skewed, one may expect the majority of data points to be concentrated around the lower end, with only a few large values pulling the mean to the right. Understanding this helps in interpreting the concentration and spread of data points.\n",
        "\n",
        "Skewness is a crucial aspect of understanding data distributions. It helps in identifying the direction of asymmetry and the presence of outliers, thereby influencing the choice of statistical methods, the interpretation of central tendency, and the robustness of conclusions. By understanding the degree of skewness in a dataset, one can better understand the characteristics of the data and make more informed decisions.\n",
